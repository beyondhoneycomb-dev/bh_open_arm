"""The publish-only, latest-wins, single-slot mailbox (`02a` §3.1 ②).

This is the *entire* surface a producer touches. A producer holds a
`TargetMailbox` and nothing else — not the scheduler, not the CAN writer — so the
single-CAN-writer guarantee (`02a` §3.1 ①) is enforced structurally: there is no
attribute path from here to a CAN handle to misuse.

Latest-wins with one slot means a producer that runs faster than the scheduler
never queues; its older targets are simply overwritten, and the scheduler always
reads the freshest. `publish` returns nothing and never blocks — it takes the lock
only to swap one reference — so a producer can never be back-pressured by, or learn
anything about, the consumer.

Threading: `publish` (producer thread) and `take_latest` (scheduler tick) are
guarded by one lock so the slot swap and the read are each atomic with respect to
the other. In the AI-offline fault-injection harness everything runs on one thread
under a controlled clock, but the lock is kept so the type is correct off the test
bench too.
